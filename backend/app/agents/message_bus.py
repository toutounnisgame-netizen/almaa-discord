"""
Message bus for interâ€‘agent communication.

The MessageBus maintains an asynchronous queue for each registered
subscriber.  When a message is published, it is dispatched to all
registered queues without blocking.  Agents call `register()` to
obtain their private queue.  Other components (e.g. WebSocket
broadcast) can also register to receive all messages.
